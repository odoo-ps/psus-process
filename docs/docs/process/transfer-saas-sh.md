## Customer must agree to the following:

If the Customer requests that the SH project and github repository be transferred to the Customer or the Partner the Customer is working with:
1. If there is any custom development created by the PSUS team
   - Customer will no longer pay maintenance to PSUS team
     - Any LOC maintenance will be removed once the github repository transfer is accepted by the customer (Responsible: AM)
   - PSUS team will no longer upgrade or maintain any custom code
     - This means no bug fixes, code upgrade, maintenance
2. Any additional assistance required from the Customer will require additional Success Pack Hours
   - PSUS does not give any estimate of how many hours the fix/upgrade will cost if the customer agrees to use these hours
3. Customer/Partner Agrees to maintain and support themselves/customer with any of these issues
4. Customer/Partner Agrees to notify PSUS team once they have successfully accepted the github repository transfer
   - Customer’s Account manager will then remove any existing maintenance fee on the subscription
5. Customer Agrees to confirm the above agreement in writing

## Steps for PSUS team to transfer ownership:

1. Make sure the Customer/Partner agrees to the above. 
   1. Have it in written confirmation attached to the subscription.
2. Ask Account Manager/BSA to create a ticket in PSUS - Technical Support for the transfer request
3. Request the Customer/Partner’s github username
4. Add the Customer/Partner’s github to the SH project as Admin collaborator
5. Ask CIC/JAM to move the github repo and transfer to the Customer/Partner’s github
6. Customer Accepts the transfer
7. Ask Account Manager/BSA to request customer tell us when the transfer is successful
8. Ask the Account Manager to remove any LOC on subscription
9. Alert KGA that any bugs or upgrades will need to be handled by the Customer/Partner not PSUS team
