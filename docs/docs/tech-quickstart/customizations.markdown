Mark the Ticket Kanban State to Red
Ping your Team Leader to Functionally Review the Specification Request
Fix any issues they bring up
If they Approve(in task chatter), you or your Team leader can mark the Ticket Kanban State to Green
Next, a member of the Technical Team will Review the Specification
