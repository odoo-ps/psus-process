This supplement document is designed to help you understand the development process and timeline which can be useful in setting expectations for customers and projecting delivery dates for development requests. This information is based on the amount of current customer development requests. 

Full development requests have three different time factors that affect the timeline of delivery. These are Development Lead Time, Development Time, and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Time.  Below is the explanation of what are those different lead times and how they affect the delivery timeline. 

## Development Lead Time

The development lead time given is not a commitment to deliver the development at a given timeframe. Rather, it is a projected timeframe of when development can be assigned to start the development (remember many things could change this projected time but we try to keep our timeline close to what was originally projected). 

The development lead starts when a task estimate is approved by the customer and the task is pushed to the "Planning" stage. Also, when a task is pushed to planning, the "Deadline" field value is set to the same day to give a quick idea of when the task was initially moved to planning. 

Developments are planned and processed on a first come first serve basis to give equal opportunity to all customers (priority escalations are accepted on a case by case based on the Teamleaderâ€™s approval, remember escalating tasks affects other project timelines. For example, if someone is waiting N weeks and they are 1 week away from assigning and we have a large escalation then it will push waiting time for customers a few weeks behind).

## Development Time

Once development is assigned someone will work on it and the developer will prepare the first iteration of the solution based on the given written specification and use cases. Here it is important to understand that the developer does not spend 100% of their daily time toward just QuickStart new development requests, they also have PS Technical Support, Migration, and  Maintenance that they work on the side every day. 

A developer spends about 40%-50% of their daily time on new development requests, 30% of time toward migration and maintenance, and 10% time toward ps technical support. If the development estimate is 24 hours, i.e. working days, then this development will usually be ready for testing in the next 7 to 8 working days (depending on their current workload).

## User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Time

Once a development is ready for UAT, it will be pushed to the UAT stage for Customer testing. Here's where we observed the longest wait time which is between four weeks and twenty weeks depending on customer availability and how responsive they are. In our experience, frequent follow-ups of UAT reminders help keep customers on track and test their development, which helps in saving some time in this stage.


With this formula to project when development will be ready is as following: 

Development Ready Time = Development Moved Planning Date + Development Lead Time + Development Time + UAT Time  

Example: 
If we have 24 Hours of development request, approved by the customer today and we push to planning today
 
Development Ready Time = 21.2 Week

Today  + Lead Time (8 weeks as of May 21st) + 1.2 Week of Development Time + 12 Week UAT (Avg)  = 21.2 Week
