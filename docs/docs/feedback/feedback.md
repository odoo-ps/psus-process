# Internal Feedback Policy

We at Odoo have an open-door management policy, and you are always welcome to talk to your Team Lead for anything that you would like to talk about. 

If there is anything you would like to talk about then I highly encourage everyone to talk to your Team Lead or your manager and share your feedback or experience (positive or negative) that you are having.

However, if you are not ready to have an open dialogue and want to share your feedback in writing then you can use [this form](https://forms.gle/9Uebve7Gw8rYXa41A) to share your feedback. This form exclusively shares your feedback with your manager. Privacy of your feedback will be maintained at all times.

Sharing your positive or negative experiences is very important as it might affect your quality of life both professionally and personally. By sharing your experience, you are not only helping yourself in the right direction to resolve it, but you are also helping Odoo create a better work environment for everyone.
Feedback also lets us know where we stand and, how can we do better.

The bottom line; your voice, and well-being are important to us, and if their anything that you think you need to share or want to talk about then I encourage you to have you open dialogue about it or write us using the feedback form shared above.
