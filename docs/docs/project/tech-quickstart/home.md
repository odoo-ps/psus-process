# Tech Quickstart
- All the development requests are managed under project “PSUS - Tech Quickstart”.
  - Project Leader : Cindey([cic@Odoo.com](mailto:cic@Odoo.com)) + Ali([aal@Odoo.com](mailto:aal@Odoo.com))
- See if development request can be avoided by:
  - Making customers try/use OOTB (out-of-the-box) Odoo
  - Proposing work around (project app can be used in many different ways)
  - See if they are willing to change their business process and save development cost.
- Pay attention to following:
  - Review your all developments when you are doing pipe review with your Coach/TL.
  - All development requests must be reviewed and approved by a Coach/TL and Project Leader.
  - Initially hours is simply estimate of hours given based on our experience for given feature(s), but a developer may end up using more or less hours.
    - The final hours that are charged to customer is based on hours spent on task (timesheets).
  - Once the task is in development the specification is frozen and no new changes(Scope Creep) are accepted, so please make sure customer review the final specification before they give it go.
