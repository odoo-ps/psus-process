# Addenda & Complement - MX

### Addenda
An addenda it is optional information which can be annexed to a **Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet (CFDI)** in order to include additional information.

An addenda can include information of different nature like commercial, logistical or operational, which is required by companies (receptors) for their providers of products or services. These companies are usually big commercial chains that belong to the sectors of sales, manufacturing, insurance to mention but a few.

The information contained in an addenda is purly commercial, and it is not part of the requirements of [SAT](https://conecta.tec.mx/es/noticias/nacional/emprendedores/que-es-el-sat) for an electronic invoice or CFDI, however, the purpose of the Addenda's content is to automate the inclusion of information for process like commodity reception and provider payments.

### Complement
A Complement is similar to Addenda, however, it is part of the requirements of [SAT](https://conecta.tec.mx/es/noticias/nacional/emprendedores/que-es-el-sat)
