# Introduction
A pre-sales is a process for sales prospect that helps to the business advisor to close a sale receiving help from consulting and/or technical team to determine how a use case from the sales prospect can be solved.

### Pre-sale mindset
Pre-sales is a limit assistance at no cost to help business advisor to close a sale as soon as possible.

## Pre-Sales Estimates
- Pre-Sales estimations include the time required for development, technical analysis, integration, project management, and functional analysis. - Time is also built in for a reliability ratio on the development hours
- This complete estimate sets realistic expectations for project implementation
- Estimates are calculated [using this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1waWz4-JIwCi_ogosXXYV8wtamKZiTQwYAYtlb4lFjY8/edit) by the Pre-Sales consultant
- In certain cases, a lower functional weight may be applied to the estimate if agreed upon by the technical & pre-sales consultants
- A lower functional weight may be used for projects where the development will require a larger proportion of hours compared to the functional implementation
- Possible examples include new payment acquirers and delivery carriers
