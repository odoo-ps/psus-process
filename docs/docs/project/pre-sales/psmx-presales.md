# Introduction
For the Pre-sales process to happen there needs to be two functional experts and one technical expert dedicated to getting the whole estimation done as soon as possible in order to maximize the chances of closing a sale. These specialists sit together in the dedicated area for presales to facilitate the communication between them. Ask your TL for the current seat location.

## Calendar and Location
The [Presales Calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/12nHpa2o0k2BU1pe19L27Ot0eH71ge04GZZHPMLwFlAU/edit) defines the next month’s distribution of the people that will attend the pipe every day. This calendar is planned according to the home office days defined by each member of the Quickstart team that is eligible to do presales and will be filled out by the person in charge of presales. 

## Prerequisites
When a ticket is moved to the Tech analysis stage in the (PSMX) PRESALES project, there are two requirements that must be met before the estimation process can start: business case, and functional specification. 
- Business case: In this section, there are two main questions that need to be answered:
    - WHAT: Explanation of the need of the customer
    - WHY: Explanation of the reason(s) why you think the feature / customization / development is necessary for the customer.
- Functional specification: In this section, there are four points that need to be defined:
    - HOW: Explanation of the way Odoo can handle the business need
    - AS IS: In the standard solution, where would we change something
    - TO BE: What’s the expected flow?

- Remarks: Additional remarks that could help clarify business needs or changes in the standard solution.

Also make sure to add the tag **PSMX-TECH** to have a tracking of which tickets had a technical estimation. 

Without this information, the estimation cannot be reliable and in the future could lead to the customers feeling like they were lied to in order to complete the sale and now they need to pay more than what was originally planned. 

## Estimation Process
Once the ticket is in the correct stage and development specifications are filled out, the technical expert will assign the ticket to themselves (without removing any existing assignees). **If the ticket is assigned to one person, it does not matter if it takes more than a day to complete the task, the responsibility of doing the estimation relies on the person in charge when the ticket was created.** 

The technical expert will figure out the changes that need to be made with a custom module and, based on the [Development Task Estimation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sU6sGSkwqwc5IhqtvNoPK-mXLp5VCJ7X__Vr3dlQGP4/edit#heading=h.qyk9ccqcdt9) document will calculate the estimated hours that the customization will take. It is crucial that the [Presales Policies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T64WZTtNbe2fpMBV0t3hLLeCYHEbV8M4CmyovhXiuWs/edit#heading=h.957bb2cjpxa9), as well as the [Estimation Policies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T64WZTtNbe2fpMBV0t3hLLeCYHEbV8M4CmyovhXiuWs/edit#heading=h.gkro5dqg4xty) are taken into consideration every time an estimation is done. 

Once the process is complete, the technical expert will move the ticket back to the In Progress stage of the project and the functional expert will communicate with the customer the approximate hours and cost for that development.
