# Rules
- Customization and Development is not same at Odoo
- Get a quote of possible developments early and set expectation in sales
- All developments will require Odoo.sh
- Exception is QWeb Reports or MX Addenda Developments
- Most small business customers do not understand how project management works so setting expectation about lead time, task estimates, timesheet and success pack hours consumption is key and helps in building successful work relation.
- Some effects of developments on QuickStart project implementation :
- Slows down QuickStart project implementation
- Development creates a delay in upgrade

### What we don’t develop :
- e-Commerce integration (Odoo does offer OOB eCommerce solution)
- Connectors to self-hosted systems or home-grown/developed systems
- Any automation that does not save time or does not help improve process when implementing Odoo
- API Integration for any feature that is available in Odoo
- Anything that looks like customer’s existing system
- Debranding (some exception may be allowed) or Backend Theme customization
- This is not a complete list, integrations may by approved on a case by case basis
