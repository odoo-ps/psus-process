| Time Notes | | Consultant Finish Specification Request Approval from Team Lead | May take longer if we need more details or followup form Consultant | If no update in eight week task will be cancelled | Depending on Lead time and size of development this may takes longer or shorter | As long as development requires based on estimated time and developer planning | If development not tested in 6 weeks then MRR will be added manually | Development is deployed in production and we can add maintenance to subscription  | | | |
| Usage Notes | | All new development request are created in stage. Each task required review from your Coach/Teal leader/Task reviewer, so as your task is ready log note and tag responsible to reviews the task  | This stage can be used by technical reviewer for putting task in this stage while they are reviewing it and gathering additional information. Consultant will require to followup on required subjects asked | Once task is estimated customer will have time to make the decision that if they want move ahead with development or not. The task will be staged for 4 to 6 weeks and and if task is no update during this time the it will be closed. When a request is cancelled, the install planned hours will be set to zero so parent task will not show change of hours. Cancelled request can be always re-open; if their is no change in specification if not it will be in requirements again. | Stage is used for queuing dev tasks before a developer starts working on them. Usual lead time here  is 1 to 2 weeks but this may vary on work load. Note that requirements specification is now frozen to what has been sent to customer in email and no new change request will be accepted, and if their is change request before we start development then we will estimate and will start from requirements stage and will go through approval. | All Active feature development that all developer working can be seen here. Development will not be ready at given hours estimate in time frame as developer has many other work they work in parallel so they plan their work according. Note that requirements specification is now frozen now, no new change request or scope screep will be accepted any more, for new requirements please start new task. | Stage for tasks under user acceptance testing.
