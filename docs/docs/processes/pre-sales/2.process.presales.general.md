- All pre sales requests are managed under project “PSUS - PreSales”.
  - Process Leader Technical: Ben ([bmu@odoo.com](mailto:bmu@odoo.com))
  - Process Leader Functional: Massiel ([mac@odoo.com](mailto:mac@odoo.com))
- Customization and Development is not same at Odoo
- Get a quote of possible developments early and set expectation in sales
- All developments will require Odoo.sh
- Exception is QWeb Reports or MX Addenda Developments
- Most small business customers do not understand how project management works so setting expectation about lead time, task estimates, timesheet and success pack hours consumption is key and helps in building successful work relation.
- Some effects of developments on QuickStart project implementation :
- Slows down QuickStart project implementation
- Development creates a delay in upgrade

### How to get a quote of developmet during Pre-Sales
- Make a copy of the following template task : [[TRIGRAM] Prospect Name : Requirements Short Title (Make copy of this)](https://www.odoo.com/web#id=2260536&cids=3&menu_id=4720&action=333&active_id=3138&model=project.task&view_type=form)
- Or send a direct email to  “[psus-presales@mail.odoo.com](mailto:psus-presales@mail.odoo.com)”
- Smart button on sales lead
- For more information on the Pre-Sales process, [check out this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xqhNsesJd1UVw26ggFjfk8eCO00sf7S7THUIgi5nvms/edit?usp=sharing)

### What we don’t develop :
- e-Commerce integration (Odoo does offer OOB eCommerce solution)
- Connectors to self-hosted systems or home grown/developed systems
- Any automation that does not save time or does not help improve process when implementing Odoo
- API Integration for any feature that is available in Odoo
- Anything that looks like customer’s existing system
- Debranding (some exception may be allowed) or Backend Theme customization
- This is not a complete list, integrations may by approved on a case by case basis

### Pre-Sales Estimates
- Pre-Sales estimates include the time required for development, technical analysis, integration, project management, and functional analysis. - Time is also built in for a reliability ratio on the development hours
- This complete estimate sets realistic expectations for project implementation
- Estimates are calculated [using this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1waWz4-JIwCi_ogosXXYV8wtamKZiTQwYAYtlb4lFjY8/edit) by the Pre-Sales consultant
- In certain cases, a lower functional weight may be applied to the estimate if agreed upon by the technical & pre-sales consultants
- A lower functional weight may be used for projects where the development will require a larger proportion of hours compared to the functional implementation
- Possible examples include new payment acquirers and delivery carriers
