## Code review

- If customer doesnâ€™t have code developed from Odoo Inc.(i.e. 3PA, DIY Devs, Partner Devs)
  - Events that result in this situation.
    - Partner goes AWOL.(Customer still paying maintenance.)
    - Customer wants to move to Odoo from partner
- Primary step in this scenario to request code review for upgrade.
- Create a task in PSUS - Maintenance by making a copy of the following template task :
  - [[CODE REVIEW TEMPLATE][TRI/QUADGRAM] Customer Name : Code Review & Estimate](https://www.odoo.com/web#id=2908771&cids=3&menu_id=4720&action=333&active_id=3137&model=project.task&view_type=form)
- If we decide to upgrade based on the code review we can start upgrade only after customer pays quoted MRR for for past 12 months and agrees to actively pay it in the future.
- For any queries regarding this you can directly contact the project m of PSUS - Maintenance.
