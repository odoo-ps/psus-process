# PSUS Tech - Who are we?

### Introduction 

PSUS Tech is Odoo's best department, if you are in the team, you are among the luckiest humans on the planet! We are a team of about 60 developers, distributed in Buffalo, Mexico City and San Francisco. Our manager is Jigar (jam) , he supervises our work and makes sure everything runs smoothly.

### What do we do? 

We do a lot of different things: we estimate developments, provide tech support, analyze projects, migrate customers to newer versions, review each other’s code, write documentation, and of course write code for those developments.

### Why does PSUS Tech even exist?

Imagine you are a customer, you use Odoo for your company but you have specific needs that the product as it is doesn’t cover. This is where we come in. We will analyze your needs, estimate how much time it will take us, and do it. Now your workflow with Odoo is nice and smooth. 

### Different Teams inside the team 

Since we do so many things, we organize our tasks by projects, each project has a Project Leader.

1. Maintenance and Migrations (KGA): In this team, you do two things. You either maintain or you upgrade the client's database. What does that even mean? Well, let's say you are a client of Odoo and you asked for a customization to be done. At first glance and after a lot of tests, everything seemed all right. The customization is pushed to the production database, you use it, everything is fine. But, after two months, you get a traceback error! What does that mean? What do you do? You contact the maintenance team and they will fix the issues for you. Ok, great, the maintenance team maintains but what about the upgrades? Upgrades are Odoo version changes.
2. PreSales (BMU): These are the people clients contact to have their project analyzed, they work with the Business Analysts and try to fulfill the client’s needs. They will make a technical analysis and give an estimation of how much time the development might take.
3. Tech Quickstart (CIC): When the client approves to proceed with the development, this team will make it come true. They ensure the clients' needs are fulfilled by typing on their keyboard and doing code magic. When they have developed and tested the customization development, they make it available to the BA who will then test it and provide it to the client.
4. Tech Support (BRC): This team is in charge of helping clients with their technical questions. Some clients prefer to develop their customization by themselves and they do not go through our services but, if they have technical difficulties, they can contact this team.
