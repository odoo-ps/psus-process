# Customization 
Tasks that can be done by the functional consultant. Functional consultants should know how to perform all these tasks.

# Development
 Should be done by Odoo’s technical team

- SaaS Customers: there is a cap of 15 hours for developments. These should be simple developments (New PDF reports, modifying existing reports, new views, etc. Anything related to QWEB or MX Addenda), the technical team will evaluate if the development is feasible in SaaS.
- Odoo.sh Customers: No hour cap. If an integration is needed please refer to this document [Integrations](integrations doc).

Note: As a company policy if any development is done, internally (with Odoo) or externally (by the customer), the customer will be charged maintenance, make sure you make the customer aware of this to avoid any future conflict.

# Development vs Customzation
Anything that can be done with the drag and drop features of Studio’s interface is considered Customization. 
This document specifies what is a Development beyond that:
